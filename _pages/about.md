I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Arizona State University in Prof. Allison Nobleâ€™s group. My research is primarily focused on the evolution of galaxies, with a particular interest in how galaxies in the densest environments - clusters - evolve in different ways than galaxies in the field. I use a variety of instruments spanning a wide range of wavelengths, but am primarily focused on high-resolution instruments including ALMA and HST.

High resolution study of stars and gas can help us to unravel effects that strongly influence the evolution of galaxies across cosmic time. Thus far, my research results have included the some of the first detections of direct molecular gas stripping, and previously stripped gas falling back. I have also lead some of the first resolved studies of cluster galaxy kinematics up to a redshift of z ~ 1.6.
